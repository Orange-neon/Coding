#  Algorithmic Problem-Solving Portfolio

Welcome to my central repository for algorithmic research and competitive programming. This collection represents my journey from foundational logic to advanced optimization, with a focus on technical rigor and efficient code implementation.

---

##  Overview
This repository contains a curated selection of solutions to non-trivial problems from various platforms and curricula:
* **X-Camp:** Advanced training in data structures and algorithm design.
* **USACO:** Competitive solutions from the USA Computing Olympiad (**Bronze/Silver**).
* **Codeforces & CodeChef:** Implementations focused on global competitive rounds.

##  Key Focuses
I prioritize writing code that is not just "correct," but optimized for performance. Key areas of exploration include:

* **Optimization:** Implementing structures like **Monotonic Queues** to reduce $O(n^2)$ approaches to $O(n)$.
* **Graph Theory:** BFS/DFS applications and shortest-path algorithms.
* **Data Structures:** Efficient use of Segment Trees, Heaps, and Hash Maps.
* **Complexity Analysis:** Rigorous testing against strict time limits (aiming for sub-second execution).

##  Why
I believe that the discipline of competitive programming—debugging under pressure, optimizing for edge cases, and ensuring algorithmic transparency—is the essential foundation for **Responsible AI in Healthcare**. 

My goal is to apply this technical "deep-diving" to build diagnostic tools that are as efficient as they are equitable. I am particularly interested in how optimized algorithms can reduce **diagnostic delay** in complex medical cases.
